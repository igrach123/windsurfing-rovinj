                <p class="text-muted">A scenic boat tour around the old town of Rovinj and its islands, to the island of
                    Sv. Ivan, where you have leisure time for exploring the nature, swimming and diving in the clear
                    sea, or just enjoying the sunshine and the views of the nearby lighthouse.
                    Our next stop is the island of Dvije Sestrice (the Two Sisters), and on the drive there we serve you
                    delicious canap√©s and drinks. Next is a 30-minute break for a swim in the turquoise sea of the
                    picturesque cove between the islands where you can explore the interesting underwater flora and
                    fauna. After the day in the sun, we refresh you with some chilled fresh fruit whilst driving back to
                    Rovinj.
