                    Weâ€™ve all done it because it seems right at the time. You want the paddle to scoop the water as
                    you try to balance and paddle without falling in. However, as we all eventually find out, the
                    paddle goes the other way as it works more effectively when in the standing position and also
                    results in a smoother paddle stroke and less stress on your shoulders and elbows. As the shaft
                    is the leading edge you pull the blade through the water in a slightly trailing position which
                    aids blade stability and as you perform the SUP stroke, the blade is vertical providing the best
                    angle through the middle of the stroke for the most power.</b>
